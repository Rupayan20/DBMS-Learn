Day-9: What is Primary Key in DBMS | Primary Key with examples            

Primary Key: {Unique Key + Not Null}

Example: If we consider the school management system; in a family, two members of child use same phone number. 
        They don't have email id, Aadhar number yet. So, in this case, Registration number or Enrollment number is primary key.
        In the management system, they give the primary key to the users. 
        
In database, Candidate key > 1;
             Primary key = 1

Another Example, when we applied for new Aadhar, then in their databse our all data is stored.
                 And given Aadhar number (or, Unique Application Id) is primary key there.
