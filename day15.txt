Day 15: Types of Attributes in E-R Model | Full Concept 

-> Types of Attributes:

        i) Single vs Multivalue Attributes: A single-valued attribute is an attribute that can hold only a single value for a particular entity in an entity set.
                                            A multivalued attribute is an attribute that can hold multiple values for a particular entity.

                                                                 _____________
           _________                +-----------+               /  _________  \
       /              \  <--------> |  Student  | <----------> /  /         \  \
      ( Enrollment No. )            +-----------+             (   ( Phone No.) )
       \   _________  /                   ^                    \   \_________/  /
                                          |                     \_____________ /
                                          |
                                          ˅
                                    _____________
                                   /             \
                                  /   _________   \
                                 (   ( Address )   )
                                 \   \_________/  /
                                  \_____________ /


        ii) Simple vs Comprise Attributes: A simple attribute is an attribute that cannot be divided further into smaller parts. It is atomic, meaning it represents a single piece of information about an entity.
                                           A composite attribute is an attribute that can be divided into smaller subparts, which represent more basic attributes with independent meanings.
                                                                                       
           _________                +-----------+                  _________  
       /              \  <--------> |  Student  | <---------->    /         \  
      ( Enrollment No. )            +-----------+                (  Address  ) 
       \   _________  /                   ^                       \_________/  
                                          |                      ⬋     ⬇    ⬊
                                          |                   City  District  State
                                          ˅
                                      _________ 
                                     /         \  
                                    ( Full name )   
                                     \_________/ 
                                    ⬋     ⬇     ⬊
                                 First   Middle  Last 
                                 Name     Name   Name 


        iii) Stored vs Derived Attributes: A stored attribute is an attribute whose value is physically stored in the database. It represents actual data that is directly entered and maintained by users.
                                           A derived attribute is an attribute whose value is not stored directly in the database. Instead, it is derived or calculated from other stored attributes.

           _________                +-----------+                  _________  
       /              \  <--------> |  Student  | <---------->    /         \  
      ( Date of Birth  )            +-----------+                (    Age    ) 
       \   _________  /                                           \_________/  
                                                                       ⬇    
                                                            Derived from "Date of Birth"                             


        iv) Key vs Non-Key Attributes: A key attribute (or simply a key) is an attribute (or a combination of attributes) that uniquely identifies each tuple (record) in a relation (table). It ensures that no two rows have the same value(s) for the key attribute(s).
                                       Non-key attributes are the attributes that are not part of any candidate key or primary key of a table. They provide additional information about the entity but do not contribute to uniquely identifying the records.

        /             \   <--------->   |   Student   |  <--------->   /         \
       ( Date of Birth )                +------------+                (    Age    )
        \_____________/                       ^                        \_________/

         _________                            |                           _________  
       /           \                          |                         /          \
      (   Gender    )                         |                        (  Address   )
       \___________/                          ˅                         \__________/   
                                           _________

        v) Required vs Optimal Attribute: Attributes that must have a value for every instance of an entity. These attributes are crucial for defining the entity and cannot be left empty or null.
                                           Attributes that may or may not have a value for an instance of an entity. These attributes are not mandatory and can be left empty or null.

       ( Family Income )                +------------+                (    Age    )
        \_____________/                       ^                        \_________/

         _________                            |                           _________  
       /           \                          |                         /          \
      (   Email     )                         |                        (  Address   )
       \___________/                          ˅                         \__________/

                                          [Required]
 
 
        vi) Complex Attribute: A Complex Attribute in an Entity-Relationship (E-R) model is an attribute that is composed of multiple sub-attributes, 
                                which can be either simple or composite. Essentially, a complex attribute is a combination of  "composite and multivalued" attributes.
