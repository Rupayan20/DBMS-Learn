Day-2: File System vs DBMS | Diadvantages ofFile System | DBMS Advantages of File System

i) Searching: In file system, when we fetch the particular data, but we have to access all data then according our needs we check our need.
              But in DBMS, using query we have to access the data which we want, se Searching time is faster.

ii) Attributes: When we want to use our data in file system, we have to depend in aatributes (like location).
                But in DBMS, users don't know about the server details/location. They just have to fetch their data easily.

iii) Concurrency: In file system, if more than one user access the data at a time, then concurrency happens.
                  But in DBMS, at a time, more than one user access the data. No concurrency happens.

iv) Security: In file system, the security protocol is not presented.
              But in DBMS, there is many roles (like: Super Admin, Admin, User) and the security is high.

v) Redundancy: In file system, data redundancy occurs.
               But in DBMS, there is primary, unique key and using this data, redundancy never occurs.
