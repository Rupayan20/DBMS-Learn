Day 19: Question to Minimize tables in E-R

Question> What is minimum number of tables required to represent this E-R Model to Relational Model?
                  A) 2           B) 3
                  C) 4           D) 5
                    ______
                   /  R1  \  
                   \______/ 
                  /       \
               1 /         \ M
                /           \
       +------+              +------+
       |  E1  |              |  E2  |
       +------+              +------+
        |      \            /      |
        |     M \          / N     |
       (A)       \        /       (B)
                   ______
                  /  R2  \  
                  \______/

Ans> Here, A and B -> Attributes
           E1 and E2 -> Entities
           R1 and R2 -> Relations

Entities and Relationships:
E1: Entity 1 with attribute A (primary key)
E2: Entity 2 with attribute B (primary key)
R1: 1-to-many relationship between E1 and E2
R2: many-to-many relationship between E1 and E2

Reducing Tables:
To represent the ER model in a relational model, we need to reduce the number of tables.

i) R1 Relationship:
In a 1-to-many relationship, the primary key is on the "many" side.
In this case, the primary key is B, which is in E2.
We can combine E1 and R1 into one table because both have the same primary key B.

ii) R2 Relationship
In a many-to-many relationship, the primary key is a combination of both entities.
In this case, the primary key is a combination of A and b.
We cannot reduce R2 into a single table because it requires both A and B as primary keys.

After reducing the tables, we have:

|-------|--------------------|
| Table |    Description     |
|-------|--------------------|
|   T1  |        E1          |
|-------|--------------------|
|   T2  | R1 and E2 combined |
|-------|--------------------|
|   T3  |        R2          |
|-------|--------------------|

The minimum number of tables required is B) 3.
